## About The Project

This is a mobile App developed in Flutter. This was the interaction Point for a relay that was build in and controlled a doorlock. It contains user authentification and a few diffrent settings like: Auto - Login, save Username and Password, and the switch between light- and darkmode. Also of course the unlocking of the door for authentificated users.
